# libRangeMap
A simple library  written in C++ that maps ranges of alphanumeric characters from one range to another.

    To use, #include the header file and declare the namespace RANGEMAP.
You will then be able to call the function MAP on alphanumeric charcters.
The default output value of numeric values is a value between 0 and 1. English language characters are converted from 1-26 respectivly. Currently only the output of numeric values can be changed because I havent needed it to otherwise.
